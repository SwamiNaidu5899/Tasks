        <center>Difference b/w Google and Chat GPT</center><hr><br>
        <h2>What is Google?</h2>
        <p>Originally known as BackRub. Google is a search engine that start
            ed development in 1996 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a resear
            ch project at Stanford University to find files on the Internet.
             Larry and Sergey later decided the name of their search engine n
             eeded to change and chose Google, inspired by the term googol. T
             he company is headquartered in Mountain View, California.</p>
        <h2>What is Chat GPT?</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT is a computer program designed to generate text that 
            resembles human language developed by open Ai. It does this 
            by using a machine learning model that has been trained on a
            large amount of text data. The program can then generate text
             based on the patterns it learned from the training data, mak
             ing it capable of generating human-like responses to prompts
             . ChatGPT is used because of its ability to generate human-like
              text and its versatility in handling various language generati
              on tasks. It can generate text in multiple languages, understa
              nd and generate context-sensitive responses, and generate res
              ponses to a wide range of prompts. Additionally, as a deep le
              arning model, it can continue to improve and learn as it’s ex
              posed to more data. This makes it a valuable tool for a wide 
              range of applications, including chatbots, language translati
              on, and content creation.</p>

        <h2>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

            The two most common display values are block and inline.</p>

            <h3>Block level Elements:</h3>
            <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

                A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
                
                Two commonly used block elements are: 'p' and 'div'.
                
                The 'p' element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
                
                The 'div' element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</p>

                <p>Here are the block-level elements in HTML:</p> <br>

                    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
                    <p>An inline element does not start on a new line.

                        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
                        
                        This is a 'span' element inside a paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Here are the inline elements in HTML:</p>
