        <h3>Domain may refer to any of the following:</h3>
        <p>With an Internet address or name, a domain or domain
             name is the location of a website. For example, the
              domain name "google.com" points to the IP
               address "216.58.216.164". Generally, it's easier
                to remember a name rather than a long string of
                 numbers. <span>A domain
                    name contains a maximum of sixty three characters</span>,
              with one character minimum, and is entered after the protocol in the URL (uniform resource locator), as shown in the following example.</p>

        <h2>URL(Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
        <h3>What is a URL?</h3>
        <p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

            End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.</p>

                <h2>Internet</h2>
                <h3>What is the Internet?</h2>   
                <p>Internet is a global network that connects billions of computers across the world with each other and to the World Wide Web. It uses standard internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to connect billions of computer users worldwide. It is set up by using cables such as optical fibers and other wireless and networking technologies. At present, internet is the fastest mean of sending or exchanging information and data between computers across the world.</p>
                <img src="./internet.jpg" alt="">
                <p>It is believed that the internet was developed by "Defense Advanced Projects Agency" (DARPA) department of the United States. And, it was first connected in 1969.</p>

                <h2>Computer Network</h2>
             <h3>What Is a Computer Network?</h3>
            <p>A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Computing devices include everything from a mobile phone to a server. These devices are connected using physical wires such as fiber optics, but they can also be wireless.

                The first working network, called ARPANET, was created in the late 1960s and was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Government researchers used to share information at a time when computers were large and difficult to move. We have come a long way today from that basic kind of network. Today’s world revolves around the internet, which is a network of networks that connects billions of devices across the world. Organizations of all sizes use networks to connect their employees’ devices and shared resources such as printers.</p>

                <h2>WWW</h2>
                <h3>What is World Wide Web?</h3>
                <p>World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device.

                <p>
                    The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related pieces of information so that users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the advantage to select a word or phrase from text and thus to access other pages that provide additional information related to that word or phrase.

A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website, e.g., www.facebook.com, www.google.com, etc. So, the World Wide Web is like a huge electronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world.

Small websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or organizations place their WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when users of a country search their site they could get the information quickly from the nearest server.

                <h2>Website</h2>
                <h3>What is a Website?</h3>
                <p>A collection of web pages and media over the internet is called a website. The website can be published on at least one web server and can be identified by a common domain name,
                     for example - javatpoint.com, google.com, youtube.com.All the websites that are accessible publicly come under the World Wide Web. There is a website that is accessed only on a private network. Most of the websites are dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, for example, education, news, commerce, entertainment, or Social networking. The websites start with a home page, which is followed by some navigation page that is linked by the Hyperlinking between the web pages.</p>

                <h2>Webpage</h2>
                <h3>What is Webpage?</h3>
                <p>A web page or webpage is a document, commonly written in HTML (hypertext markup language) viewed in an Internet browser. A web page can be accessed by entering a URL (uniform resource locator) address into a browser's address bar. A web page may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.

                    A web page provides information to viewers, including pictures or videos to help illustrate important topics. A web page may also be used as a method to sell products or services to viewers. Multiple web pages make up a website, like our Computer Hope website.
                    
                    For example, you access a web page when you click a link provided by a search engine. The Internet consists of millions of web pages, with more being added daily.</p>
